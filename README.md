Hello!
I decided to start this project because I couldn't find any voice assistants that suited my needs.

My main ideas for this project are:
- Privacy
  - Ideally this project would be fully locally hosted
- Plugins
  - This project should support plugins so the user can add extra functionality
- Open Source
  - Sticking to the GPL baby
